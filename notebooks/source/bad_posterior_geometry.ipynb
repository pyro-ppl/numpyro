    "The hyperparameter `max_tree_depth` can play an important role in determining the quality of posterior samples generated by NUTS. The default value in NumPyro is `max_tree_depth=10`. In some models, in particular those with especially difficult geometries, it may be necessary to increase `max_tree_depth` above `10`. In other cases where computing the gradient of the model log density is particularly expensive, it may be necessary to decrease `max_tree_depth` below `10` to reduce compute. As an example where large `max_tree_depth` is essential, we return to a variant of example #2. (We note that in this particular case another way to improve performance would be to use `dense_mass=True`).\n",

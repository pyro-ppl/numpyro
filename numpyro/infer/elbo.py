class ELBO(object):
    """
    A trace implementation of ELBO-based SVI. The estimator is constructed
    along the lines of references [1] and [2]. There are no restrictions on the
    dependency structure of the model or the guide.

    This is the most basic implementation of the Evidence Lower Bound, which is the
    fundamental objective in Variational Inference. This implementation has various
    limitations (for example it only supports random variables with reparameterized
    samplers) but can be used as a template to build more sophisticated loss
    objectives.

    For more details, refer to http://pyro.ai/examples/svi_part_i.html.

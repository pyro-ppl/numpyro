    .. warning:: This is an experimental utility function that allows users to use
        JAX control flow with NumPyro's effect handlers. Currently, `sample` and
        `deterministic` sites within the scan body `f` are supported. If you notice
        that any effect handlers or distributions are unsupported, please file an issue.

    .. note:: It is ambiguous to align `scan` dimension inside a `plate` context.
        So the following pattern won't be supported

        .. code-block:: python

            with numpyro.plate('N', 10):
                last, ys = scan(f, init, xs)

        All `plate` statements should be put inside `f`. For example, the corresponding
        working code is

        .. code-block:: python

            def g(*args, **kwargs):
                with numpyro.plate('N', 10):
                    return f(*arg, **kwargs)

            last, ys = scan(g, init, xs)

    .. note:: Nested scan is currently not supported.

    .. note:: We can scan over discrete latent variables in `f`. The joint density is
        evaluated using parallel-scan (reference [1]) over time dimension, which
        reduces parallel complexity to `O(log(length))`.

        A :class:`~numpyro.handlers.trace` of `scan` with discrete latent
        variables will contain the following sites:

            + init sites: those sites belong to the first `history` traces of `f`.
              Sites at the `i`-th trace will have name prefixed with
              `'_PREV_' * (2 * history - 1 - i)`.
            + scanned sites: those sites collect the values of the remaining scan
              loop over `f`. An addition time dimension `_time_foo` will be
              added to those sites, where `foo` is the name of the first site
              appeared in `f`.

        Not all transition functions `f` are supported. All of the restrictions from
        Pyro's enumeration tutorial [2] still apply here. In addition, there should
        not have any site outside of `scan` depend on the first output of `scan`
        (the last carry value).

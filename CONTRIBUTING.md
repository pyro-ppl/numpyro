# Development

Please follow our established coding style including variable names, module imports, and function definitions.
The NumPyro codebase follows the [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
(which you can check with `make lint`) and follows
[`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) import order (which you can enforce with `make format`).

# Setup

To set up local development environment, install NumPyro from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro.git
# install jax/jaxlib first for CUDA support
pip install -e .[dev,test,doc,examples]  # contains additional dependencies for NumPyro development
```

For running `make doctest`, [install pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

# Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please autoformat code and ensure that unit tests pass locally
```sh
make lint              # linting
make format            # runs black and isort
make test              # linting and unit tests
make doctest           # test module's docstrings
```

To run all tests locally in parallel, use the `pytest-xdist` package
```sh
pip install pytest-xdist
pytest -vs -n auto
```

To run a single test from the command line
```sh
pytest -vs {path_to_test}::{test_name}
# or in cuda mode and double precision
JAX_PLATFORM_NAME=gpu JAX_ENABLE_X64=1 pytest -vs {path_to_test}::{test_name}
```

# Profiling

TensorBoard can be used to profile NumPyro following the instructions following [JAX documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiling.html).

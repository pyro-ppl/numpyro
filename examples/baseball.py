Original example from Pyro:
https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/blob/dev/examples/baseball.py

Example has been adapted from [1]. It demonstrates how to do Bayesian inference using
NUTS (or, HMC) in Pyro, and use of some common inference utilities.

As in the Stan tutorial, this uses the small baseball dataset of Efron and Morris [2]
to estimate players' batting average which is the fraction of times a player got a
base hit out of the number of times they went up at bat.

The dataset separates the initial 45 at-bats statistics from the remaining season.
We use the hits data from the initial 45 at-bats to estimate the batting average
for each player. We then use the remaining season's data to validate the predictions
from our models.

Three models are evaluated:
 - Complete pooling model: The success probability of scoring a hit is shared
     amongst all players.
 - No pooling model: Each individual player's success probability is distinct and
     there is no data sharing amongst players.
 - Partial pooling model: A hierarchical model with partial data sharing.


We recommend Radford Neal's tutorial on HMC ([3]) to users who would like to get a
more comprehensive understanding of HMC and its variants, and to [4] for details on
the No U-Turn Sampler, which provides an efficient and automated way (i.e. limited
hyper-parameters) of running HMC on different problems.
